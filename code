Description:

Before you start:

Create the folder: "singularity_containers" in your working directory
Create the folder "SRA_data"
You need to have the sra-toolkit installed (https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools)
Configure sra-toolkit (user repository: home/cq/NGS/cq-examples/exam/SRA_data)
To run the script

You can change accession number and output directory (default: "SRA_data").

You run the script via (example): $ nextflow run NGS_workflow.nf --accession SRR11192680 -profile singularity (if nexflow is in your PATH)

$ ./nextflow run NGS_workflow.nf --accession SRR11192680 -profile singularity (if nextflow in your directory)

What does the script do:

It uses 4 predefinded processes which are imported by include { xxx } from "yyy":

prefetch: downloads all necessary sra files (depending on accession number) in ".../SRA_data/sra/accession.sra"

fastq-dump: Extracts fastq-file(s) from SRA-accessions

fastqc: check the quality of our sequence reads, creates ".html" and ".zip" file

fastp: Fastp provides fast all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files (trimming, creates report)
